## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
The purpose of this challenge is to create a weather application using the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. 
​
### User Story
​
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
​
### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery
- Moment.js
- OpenWeather One Call API
​
### What I learned
​
This project allowed me to learn more about fetchin information from the server side API using the ```fetch() function```. I was also able to further implement dynamic display that changes with user input. I was able to implement previously learned skill such as saving and getting data from local storage and using the ```event.target```.

​
### Continued development
​
I would like to explore other APIs and make other applications with the data that it provides. There are thousands of APIs that I can play around with and many that are useful to everyday life. This weather dashboard is only one way to implement OpenWeather One Call API. Based on it's documentation, this API can be used several ways. This API alone has several ways to be used. 
​
### Useful resources
​
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - As always, their easy to read guides and examples were helpful when I forget how to implement specific command or function, to format with css, or tricks with javascript
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - There are always answers to previously asked questions that are relevant to my current dilemma. 
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) - Their documentation was easy to read as I was able to format my dashboard easily
